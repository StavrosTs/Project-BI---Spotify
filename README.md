# Project-BI---Spotify
Data Analysis in Spotify Dataframe 2017-2021

   1. PowerBI project
       - The PowerBI project is oriented around my previous EDA project. Here is the link.                               (https://github.com/StavrosTs/Project-EDA---Spotify)
       - Basically, i must create a presantation with interactive dashboards and i chose PowerBI.
       - I inserted my previous data and i created a PowerBI which i can't upload, so i uploaded an image file.
       
   2. Presentation
       - It consists of a selection list and 2 slicers with years,months & rankings respectively.
       - I created 2 bar plots which visualize total streams per year & month.
       - A pie chart which shows total streams before & after covid.
       - A line chart with the top 10 artists based on their total streams.
       - Finally, a funnel chart which visualizes the top 10 simplified genres. I chose funnel chart because i            wanted to emphasize in the propotional difference between the first & the rest of genres.
